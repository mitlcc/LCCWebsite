                    My name is Luisa Apolaya Torres, Class of 2021. I'm a
                    product designer living in Austin, TX, and I just spent the
                    last 8 months confounding a startup tackling affordable
                    housing in the city.

                    What motivated you to start Club Peru?
                  </p>
                  <p className="history-answer">
                    I helped bring Club Peru together, especially during my
                    sophomore year. The story of how it was founded goes back to
                    alumni Matias Hanco, Naomi Quispe, and Joaquin
                    Girarldo-Laguna. Mat칤as and Naomi we're '18 I think - but
                    they approached me and Ryan Mansilla ('21) my freshman year
                    and told us they really wanted to bring Peruvians together
                    on campus, especially since then there was the hype of the
                    World Cup and Peru qualifying for the first time! That a was
                    a very exciting time.
                  </p>
                  <p className="history-answer">
                    Their motivation was making a space to celebrate Peruvian
                    culture in the LCC - because our food and media and history
                    are pretty distinct from the established groups, like LUCHA.
                    There was a need to also make the LCC inviting for all South
                    American cultures at the time, that was a big not obstacle,
                    but general observation that the LCC could improve its
                    outreach to all Latine students - especially international
                    and Spanish-speaking students of different Latine cultures.

                    How important was the LCC (and affiliated orgs) to your time
                    at MIT?
                  </p>
                  <p className="history-answer">
                    My freshman year, I wasn't very involved in the LCC. I used
                    to go to Casino Rueda practices whenever I could, but didn't
                    really get involved until upperclassman who were Peruvian
                    invited me to be a part of the board. They were really
                    encouraging and motivated to think that I could bring
                    something good to the community. My sophomore fall, I joined
                    the LCC board as director of external relations, and the
                    following years, I was director of publicity and Sin L칤mite
                    chair. My last years, I led a musical theater production of
                    In the Heights and a virtual freshman mentorship program
                    during COVID 19. (Also off the record, I was part of the
                    group that organized the Latine hackathon in Lobby 7, fun
                    times 游때游때游때)

                  <p className="history-answer">
                    My name is Vitoria, and I was at MIT from 2014 to 2018. I am
                    originally from Houston, Texas. I participated in WISE and
                    Interphase and those things for me were important to have a
                    community at MIT. Even today, the people I keep in touch
                    with the most are from Interphase - those are my besties for
                    life.

                  <p className="history-question">
                    How did you get involved in SHPE?
                  </p>
                  <p className="history-answer">
                    Back then, I was one of the peope that showed up to every
                    event. To be honest, I started going because I first heard
                    about the Brazilian food, and I'm half Brazilian. I decided
                    to run for exec positions out of responsibility - I got so
                    much out of it like opportunities, going to the conference,
                    and even the scholarship and I felt like I needed to give
                    back. I started as Secretary and then ran for to be
                    President. I really enjoyed my team on the exec board. The
                    club has always performed very successfully and gotten lots
                    of funding support and sponsorships. The team was a well
                    oiled machine. Our exec team was very close and we got to go
                    to Fogo and even Cape Cod! I still keep up with them every
                    now and then and occasionally chat with the vice president
                    of the time.

                    Do you have any advice for incoming students?
                  </p>
                  <p className="history-answer">
                    I really enjoyed my time at MIT and doing Interphase. I'd
                    say if you have a chance to do that you should go for it,
                    it's a really good opportunity. You just have to find your
                    own beat! It is good to get invovled with clubs like SHPE
                    earlier on, especially Freshman or sophomore year, because
                    there are lots of opportunities at companies and getting
                    help with you resume is important. I interview students who
                    apply to MIT and one thing I always tell them that there are
                    so many opportunities at MIT, even within the LCC, and a lot
                    of people feel this pressure to really take advantage of
                    everything and it's simply not possible. You may not feel
                    like you are doing a lot, but you are.
