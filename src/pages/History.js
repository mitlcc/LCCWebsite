                  <p className="history-answer">
                    My name is Luisa Apolaya Torres, Class of 2021. I'm a
                    product designer living in Austin, TX, and I just spent the
                    last 8 months confounding a startup tackling affordable
                    housing in the city.

                  <p className="history-question">
                    What motivated you to start Club Peru?
                  </p>
                  <p className="history-answer">
                    I helped bring Club Peru together, especially during my
                    sophomore year. The story of how it was founded goes back to
                    alumni Matias Hanco, Naomi Quispe, and Joaquin
                    Girarldo-Laguna. Mat칤as and Naomi we're '18 I think - but
                    they approached me and Ryan Mansilla ('21) my freshman year
                    and told us they really wanted to bring Peruvians together
                    on campus, especially since then there was the hype of the
                    World Cup and Peru qualifying for the first time! That a was
                    a very exciting time.
                  </p>
                  <p className="history-answer">
                    Their motivation was making a space to celebrate Peruvian
                    culture in the LCC - because our food and media and history
                    are pretty distinct from the established groups, like LUCHA.
                    There was a need to also make the LCC inviting for all South
                    American cultures at the time, that was a big not obstacle,
                    but general observation that the LCC could improve its
                    outreach to all Latine students - especially international
                    and Spanish-speaking students of different Latine cultures.

                  <p className="history-question">
                    How important was the LCC (and affiliated orgs) to your time
                    at MIT?
                  </p>
                  <p className="history-answer">
                    My freshman year, I wasn't very involved in the LCC. I used
                    to go to Casino Rueda practices whenever I could, but didn't
                    really get involved until upperclassman who were Peruvian
                    invited me to be a part of the board. They were really
                    encouraging and motivated to think that I could bring
                    something good to the community. My sophomore fall, I joined
                    the LCC board as director of external relations, and the
                    following years, I was director of publicity and Sin L칤mite
                    chair. My last years, I led a musical theater production of
                    In the Heights and a virtual freshman mentorship program
                    during COVID 19. (Also off the record, I was part of the
                    group that organized the Latine hackathon in Lobby 7, fun
                    times 游때游때游때)
